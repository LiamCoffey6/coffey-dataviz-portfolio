# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hello! My name is Liam Coffey and I am a Master's Student in Public Policy and Management at the John Heinz III College at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I got my Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State University, go Cyclones!
I began my career at the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) where I worked in the Water Master Planning Team for nearly three years. During my time at SAWS my team and I worked together to plan the future growth of the water system and solved existing issues in the field. It was here that I developed my passion for public service and decided to attend Grad School so I could better transition my career into City Management.
My time so far at CMU has been an incredible experience. I have learned so many new skills and tools to prepare myself for my future career. I am excited to learn about Telling Stories with Data to add to my already growing tool belt.

# What I hope to learn
This course has been at the top of my list of classes to take at CMU and so I hope to learn the following:

- Improve how I communicate information about data.
- New tools for managing data and creating data visualizations.
- Expand how I think about data insights.

After graduating from CMU I plan to reenter the local government sector. The new skills I have learned at CMU will prepare me to be a more effective public servant and eventual leader.
