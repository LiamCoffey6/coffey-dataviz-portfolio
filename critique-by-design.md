# Title
MakeoverMonday Redesign Challenge: Top Migration Destination in 2025

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

## Step two: the critique

This Data Visualization does a good job of presenting all of the available data. The use of a Table is a simple format that allows the viewer to reference every data point with ease. Unfortunately the table does present some weaknesses in visualization type and color scheme. While all data points are available, it is very difficult to compare countries across categories other thatn "Total Score". The color scheme selected for this table is also very weak. Blue as a low score makes it difficult to read the numbers and yellow as a high score is counter intuitive.

My overall scores were as follows:

Usefulness:      7/10
Completeness:   10/10
Perceptibility:  6/10
Truthfulness:   10/10
Intuitiveness:   7/10
Aesthetics:      3/10
Engagement:      6/10


## Step three: Sketch a solution

<script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1758206048597');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions Asked:


- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is it easy to compare data points?

- How does the color scheme feel?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

In Class Interviewee 1 Summary

Difficult to compare between countries
Would like to know actual numbers
Circles make it difficult to understand

In Class Interviewee 2 Summary

Eyes have a hard time tracking from country to data point
Unsure what the first column "Total Score" meant
With the bubbles had numbers in them

In Class Interviewee 2 Summary

Would like more takeaways from the title
Wishes the bubbles were filled in and not hollow.
Difficulty distinguishing between countries.

Public Health Master's Student Summary

Liked the cleaness of the visualization
Wants the color legend to be closer to the data quicker understanding
Found the naming scheme for "High Livability" to be odd

Synthesis: 

Based on this feedback it was clear that the data was still difficult to interpret. The Interviewees had a hard time zeroing in on a country and interpreting its data on its own. This was due to the difficulty of tracking the name of the country back to its bubbles. Interviewees believed that some interactivity solved the issue of the bubbles being difficult to interpret. By hovering over the data points they could digest the data they wanted. The ability to reorder data in different columns allows the user to compare countries over most desireable quality.

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._

For my final iteration of the data visualization I figured readibility was the most important change. By including varying colored grid for each country, the viewer has an easier time viewing each countries data points. I also update the number of tick marks so there were more references to where the bubbles were in the range. Finally I changed "High Livability" to "Livability" to simplify what the field was saying. The visualization remains interactable and can be tailored to the viewers needs.

I found this critique process to be incredibly helpful. My main goal in this redesign was to make the data more comparable and legible, and the input from the Interviewees let me know that I wasn't quite there. I believe I was able to get the visualization to a point where it is clean, readible, and informative. Please see below:
