# Outline
High-level summary

	Water is a vital resource for sustaining our day-to-day lives. The massive investment and manpower needed to operate the systems that supply this water goes mostly unnoticed to the average person. As our need for water grows and climate change brings more uncertainties, a large portion of the US will be pushed ever closer to a water crisis. 

 
	To understand the factors that contribute to these challenges I will look to San Antonio as a case study. The challenges San Antonio is facing stem primarily from rising temperatures, limitations on available water resources, and large population growth. Recent years in San Antonio have seen unprecedented temperatures, increasing water waste, and low aquifer levels. When you become a full-time resident in a new city, what your local government does to manage its water matters. Know the challenges and promote smart planning and management.

 
Project Structure

Setup: 
Introduce the audience to the City of San Antonio. Show how it has grown over the past few decades and introduce the audience to how the water system works. Give an introduction to Aquifers and an understanding of the quantities of water used in the system.

Conflict: 
Pivot into talking about the rising temperatures, dwindling water supply levels, and how they interact together. Introduce how water is wasted in the system. Show how widespread these challenges are across the US.

Resolution:
Talk about solutions like dense urban planning, further drought restrictions, and water usage patterns that can be mitigated. Inform how the audience can participate in promoting good urban planning and conservation.


## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
The Data sources I have selected come from publicly accessible data. I plan to focus on exact water usage, water loss reports, and Water Resource Level data which will inform the state of water resources in the region. I will then focus on the causes of water resource strain, which includes temperature data, population growth, and population density. Finally I will utilize national Water Strain Data to emphasize how widespread this issue is around the US.

# Method and medium
For this project I plan to primarily use Tableau and ArcGIS Story maps. A combination of data visualizations and maps will be sufficient to tell the story of water utilities in the City of San Antonio.
