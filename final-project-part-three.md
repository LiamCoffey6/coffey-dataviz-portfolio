# Changes made since Part II

Since Part II I have made a number of changes to my project. The first change I made was to reposition my chart on Temperature. This chart was originally placed before I talked about water resources, which created a bit of a gap in describing the problem and disjointed the water resources from the system growth section. By placing this section here, the audience can understand how drastic the effect of temperature is on water resources, then allowing the presentation to talk about this effect on the Edwards Aquifer after. I also extended the timeline on the Temperature chart to go back all the way to 1893 so the audience can understand the drastic changes in temperature completely.

The second change I made to the presentation was to simplify my call to action. Originally I had a number of suggestions at the end of the presentation, but decided to focus on one. Calling the audience to promote increased water rates covers all of the issues discussed in the presentation. This call to action is thoughful and backed up by research and its drastic nature is substantiated by the data in the presentation.

Lastly, I made small changes to the end of some slides to make them flow better into the others. The feedback on Canvas had many suggestions, particularly with the system growth transition and Edwards Aquifer data as the final aspect of the presentation. I have tweaked these transitions and filled out my final remaining data slides to provide the information necessary to flow into the next section. The data visualizations on the Edwards Aquifer also needed to be cleaned up so the audience can understand the measurements.

## The audience

For my intended audience I have slightly tweaked the group to be more broad and just target individuals planning to move to drought afflicted regions of the US. I originally identified Masters Students as my audience, however this group is narrow and tailoring this presentataion specifically to them does not change the subject matter. Masters students still fit within the target audience so presenting this in class will still be relevant.

For the final stages of this project I used google AI search assistant to find relevant information regarding Lake Mead and rate increase research.

# Final thoughts

After completing the Shorthand storyboard I feel very positive about this presentation. Utilities and infrastructure are not commonly thought of in daily life; the systems that deliver them to you, the people making them work, and the risks associated. The information that could be presented in this project could go on for hours and hours. Issues like pipe materials, life span, and decay analysis. Deeper dives into rate changes and economic analysis. Despite these interesting avenues I believe that this presentation educates the general audience in a non-technical and easily digestible manner. Of the data visualization I made, I was most excited about the growing pipe network. Should I had had more time, I would have liked to make an open data request to the San Antonio Water System to get their GIS pipe data and make the visual using actual year field. Regardless, please enjoy the final product!
