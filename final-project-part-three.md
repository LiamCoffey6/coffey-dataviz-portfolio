# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Since Part II I have made a number of changes to my project. The first change I made was to reposition my chart on Temperature. This chart was originally placed before I talked about water resources, which created a bit of gap in describing the problem and disjointed the water resources from the system growth section. By placing this section here, the audience can understand how drastic the effect of temperature is on water resources, then allowing the presentation to talk about this effect on the Edwards Aquifer after. I also extended the timeline on the Temperature chart to go back all the way to 1893 so the audience can understand the drastic changes in temperature completely.

The second change I made to the presentation was to simplify my call to action. Originally I had a number of suggestions at the end of the presentation, but decided to focus on one. Calling the audience to promote increased water rates covers all of the issues discussed in the presentation. This call to action is thoughful and backed up by research and its drastic nature is substantiated by the data in the presentation.

Lastly, I made small changes to the end of some slides to make them flow better into the others. The feedback on Canvas had many suggestions, particularly with the system growth transition and Edwards Aquifer data as the final aspect of the presentation. I have tweaked these transitions and filled out my final remaining data slides to provide the information necessary to flow into the next section.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

For my intended audience I have slightly tweaked the group to be more broad and just target individuals planning to move to drought afflicted regions of the US. I originally identified Masters Students as my audience, however this group is narrow and tailoring this presentataion specifically to them does not change the subject matter. Masters students still fit within the target audience so presenting this in class will still be relevant.


## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
