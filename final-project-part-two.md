# Wireframes / storyboards
[> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

I have identified my target audience as individuals looking to establish their future residence in a new place. This story will be useful for these individuals should they find themselves in a place with strained water resources and complex local issues surrounding them. This will give these individuals knowledge for promoting development and restriction practices in their future local governments. 

For identifying representative individuals, I believe the stock of master's students we have available in Pittsburgh will suffice. These individuals are earlier on in life and are soon to make future decisions about their career and where to live. They likely are newer to participating in local government, living on their own, and paying utility bills.

## Interview script

From my research I hope to gain more information about people's baseline knowledge regarding water resources, water systems, drought, and general urban planning. Having come from the field of water utility, I have a much more expertise on the matter. This affects how I believe my data story will be perceived, so these interviews  will be important for making the information digestable to the average person. I would also like general feedback on the flow of the storytelling. I am implementing the story in a way that makes sense so me, however, the order could play a critical role in understanding.



| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Water Utility Understanding   |         Can you descirbe to me your undertanding of water resources, water infrastructure, and droughts?         |
|   Target Audience Usefulness   |         Could you imagine yourself thinking about this information in the near future?         |
|   Flow   |        Does the flow of the story make sense? Is there any information that you would have liked rearranged?          |




## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.


| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Question you asked here | Insightful feedback            |             |             |
|            Water Utility Understanding             |  Industrialization and urbanization have led to the increase of demand for water. Climate change and overconsumption have created big issues for the aquifers.   |      Understand San Antonio’s situation. Drought map gave a good understanding of where this could be a problem elsewhere.       |      Things don’t seem to well in San Antonio. Extreme growth has caused over taxing of water sources       |
|            Target Audience Usefulness             |                 Yes, plan to live in urban environment.               |      Yes, the call to action items were things you can be mindful about. Gives presentation use       |      Yes, call to action is strong and multiple prongs, not just reliant on your personal consumption       |
|            Flow             |                Would like to see the temperature part before talking about the Edwards aquifer                |       Maybe place the US context and drought at the beginning?      |       Flow was logical and informative      |

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Findings or observations from interviews | Describe what, if any changes you anticipate making to address the observation. |
|  Placement of Temperature   |  I plan to place the section about temperature in between the water sources and Edwards Aquifer seciton |
|          Grammar                |        I will clean up the storytelling do read better and have proper grammar                     |
|        One minute presentation           |              Interviewees were concerned about condensing information. Will need to test some options            |
|             |                                                                                 |

I have received very positive feedback about the storytelling so I feel confident in my ability to finish the final touches and deliver a thoughtful storyboard.
