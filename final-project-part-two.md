# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

I have identified my target audience as individuals looking to establish their future residence in a new place. This story will be useful for these individuals should they find themselves in a place with strained water resources and complex local issues surrounding them. This will give these individuals knowledge for promoting development and restriction practices in their future local governments. 

For identifying representative individuals, I believe the stock of master's students we have available in Pittsburgh will suffice. These individuals are earlier on in life and are soon to make future decisions about their career and where to live. They likely are newer to participating in local government, living on their own, and paying utility bills.

## Interview script

From my research I hope to gain more information about people's baseline knowledge regarding water resources, water systems, drought, and general urban planning. Having come from the field of water utility, I have a much more expertise on the matter. This affects how I believe my data story will be perceived, so these interviews  will be important for making the information digestable to the average person. I would also like general feedback on the flow of the storytelling. I am implementing the story in a way that makes sense so me, however, the order could play a critical role in understanding.



| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Water Utility Understanding   |         Can you descirbe to me your undertanding of water resources, water infrastructure, and droughts?         |
|   Target Audience Usefulness   |         Could you imagine yourself thinking about this information in the near future?         |
|   Flow   |        Does the flow of the story make sense? Is there any information that you would have liked rearranged?          |




## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.
